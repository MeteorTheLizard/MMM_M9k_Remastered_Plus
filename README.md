# Most important changes

All weapons have been rebalanced to be more fun and fair to shoot and play against. Additionally a few bugs have been fixed such as missing texture bugs. This pack is a lot smaller than the originals as the materials have been re-compiled and have been reduced in resolution without much quality loss which drastically decreases overall filesize.
